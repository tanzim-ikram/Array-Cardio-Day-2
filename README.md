# Array Cardio 2

## Overview
**Array Cardio 2** is a JavaScript practice project focused on working with array methods such as `some()`, `every()`, `find()`, `findIndex()`, and `splice()`. The project logs outputs to the browser console, demonstrating various operations on arrays of people and comments.

## Features
- **Checking Conditions on Arrays:**
  - Use `some()` to check if at least one person is 19 or older.
  - Use `every()` to check if all people are 19 or older.
- **Finding and Filtering Data:**
  - Use `find()` to locate a specific comment by ID.
  - Use `findIndex()` to locate a comment by ID and remove it using `splice()`.
- **Console Output:**
  - All results are logged to the browser console for easy debugging and understanding.

## Technologies Used
- HTML
- JavaScript (ES6)

## How to Use
1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser.
3. Open the **JavaScript Console** (Press `F12` or `Ctrl + Shift + I` and navigate to the **Console** tab).
4. Observe the logged results as different array methods are executed.

## Learning Outcomes
This project provides hands-on experience with:
- Using array iteration methods in JavaScript.
- Understanding how `some()`, `every()`, `find()`, `findIndex()`, and `splice()` work.
- Manipulating array data effectively.
